## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CampSphere.git
cd CampSphere
```

### 2️⃣ Start PostgreSQL Database

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start a PostgreSQL 15 container named `campsphere-postgres` on port 5432 with:
- Database: `campsphere`
- Username: `postgres`
- Password: `postgres`

### 3️⃣ Create Database Schema

The application will automatically create tables on first run using JPA/Hibernate. To populate sample data:

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x setup-database.sh
./setup-database.sh
```

**On Windows:**
```cmd
setup-database.bat
```

This will populate the database with sample camps, locations, activities, instructors, parents, and children.

### 4️⃣ Build and Run the Application

**Using Maven Wrapper (recommended):**
```bash
./mvnw clean install
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

**Or using Maven:**
```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application will start on **http://localhost:8080**
